Roadmap

Games to take inspiration from;
-spiderheck-basically everything
-bopl battle - development ideas to make it as fun as possible to play with friends 
-ps4 spiderman - abilities/grapple mechanics
-deep rock-abilities/weapons and upgrading
-ultrakill - fast paced + combat + weapons/attacks
-cup head - combat + abilities
-soul knight - abilities
-hollow knight - abilities
-pizza tower - artstyle?

Aesthetic;
-artstyle - pixel retro or..? - want it to be unique - need to integrate into mechanics or it won’t be a cool contribution
-instead of sliding along the ground, the player will have a roll/run (when close enough to ground) animation so it doesnt look goofy
-slowdown and zoom in when final kill happens
-rounds-like Chromatic aberration when large explosions
-animations for everything
-background art
-menu art/animations
-themes of different areas idk
-secrets?
-lore?
-Easter eggs?
-music?
-loading logo is just main character spinning around a point

Gameplay/mechanics;
-open source
-port to godot later on
-think about speedrunning when doing any thing
-camera follows character in a greater world and doesnt just display whole world
-left click = grapple, right click = ability
-if an enemy is moving fast enough after being hit they will explode on contact with terrain that is based off of their velocity
-bouncy blocks, teleporters etc..?
-can grapple on to enemies/teamates and then both get dragged towards each other
-point system like ultrakill or pizza tower?
-parrying stuff (even nukes? https://youtube.com/watch?v=OoVV1WThyZ8&si=bAlbe98FVQmtxb38  lol )
-combos leading to compounding damage multipliers
-level editor
-upgradeable stats or same for all? Maybe just able to upgrade attacks?
-use deep learning for some of the harder enemies and maybe a few bossfights just so it is really hard lol

Code/calcs;
-comment code
-optimise and generalise operations, optimising where possible
-clean up code/make readable
-instead of adding small number check if value is not zero in cod as if it is negative of that value it will still break
-add air resistance
-have it so you may click both at once and both inputs pressed (need to check for letting go to halt changing the endpoint)
-have the grapple disconnect automatically if too long
-unlink fps and tps/have all movement in terms of a separate value to drawing the screen each frame
-animate grapple shots - normalise from player to mouse, add to current grapple, normalise from end of new grapple to mouse, add to grapple, normalise… etc
-going right and just before going under a block then grapple up, instead of grapple going though block it wraps around
-only certain surfaces you can grapple on to (maybe could have it so that in campaign you have a chase level with being able to grapple to cranes etc) and not just thin air
-pvp damage calculated by seeing whoever was farthest from the resulting velocity after collision, and dealing damage accordingly (ie who experienced the greatest acceleraton and dealing damage to them based off of that)
-if hit an enemy but dont kill them then should deal damage and rebound instead with less vel based off of damage
-if hit an enemy and would kill, kill them in an explosion and continue on in your direction without loosing vel
-generalise all acceleration calculations cos they are all different for no reason as of now
-Have multiple instances running using .pyw filetype

character/ability ideas;
-bullets per minute kinda attack system? Could merge with stick it to the stickman type attacks? -could have osu-esque system when you click on time for certain abilities and then more powerful require a charge up so you have to hold down right click on time and it does the super ability (based off of how accurate you were)
-super smash bros smash ultimate type attack for right hold or smthn? - with animation for each?
-passsive ability?
-have more abilities that interact with terrain
-ability where you shoot ball of energy that locks an enemy / object / player in place then allows you to do the zelda thing (https://youtu.be/PMestfpYPXA?t=665)
-ability that attracts all enemies towards you for a period of time
-ability that allows you to do the anime thing of freezing time and quick-slashing all nearby enemies
-ability that puts you back in time a few seconds
-add ultrakill coins / gun
-add guy who instantly dashes to point clicked and atomises anyone he goes through
-zu worldu ability
-carrion like character? (the game carrion)
-portal gun ability character - some reference to portal like Wheatley or the anti-fall damage boots for the passive/super

Gamemode ideas;
- basketball pvp
-multiplayer
-survival endless - waves of enemies? (maybe idk)
-campaign
-super smash bros esque?
-protect a point game mode
-dungeon crawling game mode
-ratz instagib like mode
-open world mode
-maybe have a mode where it is like this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1118297097163260044/1180648036427378818/EOiX6i3UEAA_oHs.png?ex=657e2f2b&is=656bba2b&hm=1014bf9f0acc6383ed3db4b1957ba3802e5508610ffbd5ae4ef5f55b24bdc803& (imagining a guy running outside when on a long car journey)
-level where fight on an airplane so constant acceleration in one direction 
-randomly generated terrain?

Enemy ideas;
-underwater mine-looking/acting enemy ?
-rocket turret enemy?
-rocket launcher holding enemy?
-just machine gun enemy?
-helicopter enemy?
